# ShoppingCart

Add a restocking feature to a shopping cart

## Installation:
`git clone` repository and run 'http-server' in the root directory in a bash terminal.  Required: node.js and npm to run the http-server
Also require a strapi database running on localhost:1337

## Usage:
For practice and learning React

## Support:

## Roadmap:
This exercise is for educational purposes only.  I would like to add a feature that once a card has been clicked, it removes the card from the display
